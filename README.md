# ProgrammazioneDiSistema

This course is organiszd in two parts: 
- Part I (*internals*) :  deals with **internal operating system modules**, together with the main techniques and strategies for efficient **management of resources such as processors, memories, peripheral devices, files, etc.**
- Part II (*system and concurrent programming*) :  introduces **system programming techniques**, within the framework of state-of-the-art operating systems, such as Unix/Linux and Windows. **Advances concurrend programming techniques** are introduced and used.

### Course topics
Part I
- Knowledge of operating system architecture as a set of resource managers
- Understanding of the kernel modules of the operating system and ability to implement new modules
- Ability to use system calls for process and thread creation, synchronization, and termination
- Understanding of virtual memory mechanisms
- Ability to analyze and implement virtual memory management algorithms
- Knowledge of peripheral device management techniques
- Ability to analyze and implement device drivers
- Understanding of the organization of modern file systems and ability to manage them

Part II
- Understanding of system programming interfaces (API) and system calls
- Ability to analyze and develop programs based on system calls
- Ability to analyze and develop programs with advanced techniques for interacting with a file system, such as sequential, direct, and shared access to files, and directory usage
- Ability to analyze and develop programs with exception and signal handling techniques
- Ability to analyze and develop programs with advanced memory management techniques, such as allocators, memory mapping of files, and dynamic libraries
- Ability to analyze and develop concurrent process and/or thread-based programs
- Ability to analyze and develop concurrent programs with advanced techniques for synchronization, message passing, and data sharing.
